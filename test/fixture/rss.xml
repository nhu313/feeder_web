				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/legoufo.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-171" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/legoufo.jpg?w=576&#038;h=409" alt="LegoUFO" width="576" height="409" /></a></p>
<p>I really wanted this Lego set. It was the summer between 6th and 7th grade. UFOs was the newest theme, it spun, it turned into 4 vehicles, it came with 4 figures, and oh I wanted it so badly. For some reason my dad had taken me to Toys R Us. (I don&#8217;t know why, this wasn&#8217;t a common destination, perhaps we were waiting for the tires to change at the Costco next door.) But there we were, in the Lego aisle, and my dad struck a deal with me. <strong>&#8220;Write 10 short stories this summer, and I&#8217;ll buy you this Lego set.&#8221;</strong> Mind you, this was not a $10 small set, not the midrange $35. This was a top of the line, $70 set. This was major. Not only did my dad offer me this deal, he would buy it for me <em>first</em>, trusting that I would deliver later. So I did what any 12 yr old would do&#8230; I said yes, without hesitation or thinking of the work. It was the biggest Lego set I had ever gotten from my parents.</p>
<p>Summer ended. I didn&#8217;t write 10 stories. I didn&#8217;t write 5, or 3. I think&#8230;<em> maybe</em> I wrote 1, and a half. Now to be honest, I don&#8217;t really remember how my father reacted. At that age, my dad <em>did</em> have a short temper, so maybe he punished me. Maybe he let it go. Did he forget? I&#8217;m not sure. But I never did. To this day, I still feel like I short changed my dad on a very generous agreement.</p>
<p>I still wonder why my dad made that deal with me, and why specifically, for writing short stories. It&#8217;s not like I had expressed a knack for it. I didn&#8217;t have some extracurricular agenda (if anything he cared the least about all the piano, violin, kumon lessons I was doing). And furthermore, my dad never really expressed any creative goals of his own, why push it on me? I think about other strange things he pushed me to do&#8230; this one is unique&#8230; He always encouraged me to talk really fast. He was impressed when he saw other people able to just talk and tell stories very quickly, like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzbUPfoveok" target="_blank">Micro Machines Guy</a>. He said it was a skill to be able to think that fast. He was never that hard on me about grades, or girls, but don&#8217;t get me wrong, I had my fair share of sore butts and scary moments, but looking back, and even now, I think it all actually came from a place of feeling left out. And that&#8217;s where it all make sense.</p>
<p>My dad is not a social guy. He&#8217;s quiet, keeps to himself, and apparently has been this way for much of his life. He&#8217;s tried to have friends, but always felt out of place, or uncomfortable, and as a reaction, he would avoid people more. And then along comes me, a son, an extension of him. And with me he encourages all the social aspects he lacks, or always felt too afraid to expose. Have an imagination, have a quick wit and sharp tongue, play tennis and basketball like the people on tv, &#8230;include me in your life. My dad was trying to create the friend he always wanted. The cool kid, the fun guy, a friend he knew he couldn&#8217;t lose, so long as the friend didn&#8217;t reject him.</p>
<p>And that is the struggle I&#8217;ve had with my father in the most recent years. A man with essentially no friends outside of family, and the one friend he spent so much of his life to create, the one he spent $70 on a Lego set for, far away and often out of reach. He&#8217;s not always easy to get along with, but I know it&#8217;s because he wants me as a friend.</p>
<p>For the last 7 years now, I&#8217;ve been &#8220;professionally&#8221; writing stories. It took 17 years, but I feel like I&#8217;ve more than returned my end of the deal. And now, with our first <em>real</em> movie days away from principal photography, I think about how ironic it is that one of the biggest things he pushed me to do, is what keeps me too busy to call. The friend he was trying to create can&#8217;t find the time. But I know he understands, and I know from a distance he&#8217;s proud. He checks Wong Fu&#8217;s view counts, he reads comments and asks me about them. He&#8217;s the one that told us we reached 1 million subscribers! I wonder if he ever thought those short stories he wanted me to write would turn into this.</p>
<p>We start shooting our movie on Thursday. Probably the biggest leap WF has taken as a company since we graduated. I hope my dad knows I&#8217;m still thinking about that Lego set, and that I feel bad about that summer. This should make up for it, right? But maybe that&#8217;s not even the point, holding up my end of the deal. It&#8217;s just about being a good friend, the one he always wanted. As children we&#8217;re always talking about trying to be better <em>sons</em> and <em>daughters</em>&#8230; but at this age, maybe we should just be better friends.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/mom2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-162" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/mom2.jpg?w=800" alt="mom"   /></a></p>
<p>My mom is a very simple woman. She doesn&#8217;t dress fancy, doesn&#8217;t even shop, doesn&#8217;t have hobbies. The thing is, I don&#8217;t think she was always like this. In fact, I know she wasn&#8217;t. Every couple years at a wedding or something, I&#8217;ll hear snippets of stories from her college roommates/friends about when she wore miniskirts and when she&#8217;d like to go dancing. Somewhere along the way, it faded, most definitely caused by her responsibility to her family and the family she was creating with my dad&#8230; me and my sister. But I know the vibrant, talkative, bright-eyed woman is still there.</p>
<p>In recent years I&#8217;ve had an ongoing issue with my mom.</p>
<p>My mom has dedicated so much of her life to raising me and my sister. When she had me, her brain and her heart were re-wired to always think of us, save for us, spend for us, provide for us first and foremost. But I am no longer the infant, the 9-yr old, the college student needing everything in the world from her. I&#8217;m always telling her, she has nothing to provide for me anymore. I haven&#8217;t needed her money for awhile. I live far away, on my own.. It&#8217;s time for her to return her life to <em>her life</em>. Whenever I bring this up, she seems so confused, almost lost, like she doesn&#8217;t know what she could do. I tell her to spend money on herself, explore what she wants, and that she no longer needs to consider me anymore. She dedicated a great portion of her life to me, and I want her to go back to what it was like before I took over. But this is so difficult for her to change, and I realized, this isn&#8217;t her being stubborn, but actually, this is just <em>how much</em> she loves me. As a mother, it is now hard-wired in her to provide for her son and family. There is no <em>other</em> life, and even if there was, she doesn&#8217;t want it back. She lives a completely selfless life now. She finds purpose in giving to me, and my telling her it&#8217;s no longer necessary is actually sad to her, not liberating.</p>
<p>This is something I feel is probably very common in my parent&#8217;s generation. They grew up in a time when they weren&#8217;t allowed to think of their own dreams, their dream was just to start a family and create a better life for their offspring. It was a selfless time because there weren&#8217;t the luxuries and freedoms that I and our generation grew up with (and somewhat takes for granted). Think about how &#8220;lost&#8221; and &#8220;troubled&#8221; we are in our teens and twenties. Our parents went through the same thoughts and emotions, on top of the world and cultural issues of the time, immigrating, starting a new life. We can&#8217;t even come close to comprehending what they endured.</p>
<p>So perhaps it&#8217;s not that she doesn&#8217;t want to return to a past life and mentality&#8230; it&#8217;s just that she doesn&#8217;t even know how to. It was too long ago, too different, literally another life. How do you return to something that essentially doesn&#8217;t exist anymore.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve eased up on pushing her. Now it&#8217;s not about returning to the old, but <em>starting</em> something new. I buy her new shoes and clothes since she won&#8217;t get it for herself, I encourage her to try new things, and do things for herself, but in the meantime&#8230; yes I&#8217;d love to have some fruit cut for me, yes I&#8217;m keeping warm when I sleep, yes I&#8217;ll take this $50 bill. I love you mom and everything you&#8217;ve done for me, starting even before I was alive.</p>
<p><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/love.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-163" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/love.jpg?w=623&#038;h=467" alt="Love" width="623" height="467" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>Whenever I visit home, my mom tries to give me as much space as I continue to do work out of my bedroom. Every few hours she knocks and walks in w/ some type of cut fruit, this is all she can really contribute now, and I love it.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/158/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/158/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wongfuphil.wordpress.com&#038;blog=62283787&#038;post=158&#038;subd=wongfuphil&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m currently obsessed with this song.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='800' height='480' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Y8ygKnBtKAk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>When 20/20 Part 2 came out last year, I remember hearing this song and thinking, wow, that was refreshing. JT going back to a sound from what could&#8217;ve been on an NSYNC album in 2001. It&#8217;s definitely not what current Top40 radio sounds like and I appreciate that he gave us a song that felt like it could&#8217;ve been from my hs yrs. I remember thinking, man, how cool would it be if this was one of his singles and was playing on the radio, but thought, nah there&#8217;s no way it would be since it&#8217;s not the current &#8220;sound&#8221;. Thankfully, and oddly, I was proven wrong.</p>
<p>Makes me feel like it&#8217;s the last day of school, and all my friends are hanging out by the parking lot saying bye, taking pictures, signing yearbooks. And then I take her hand and we walk to my car. She gets in and we drive through shaded streets, winding through the hills. The sunroof is open and I see her lift her hands up to feel the air and sunlight through her fingers. I turn this song up a little louder. It&#8217;s a cliche moment, but one that I always wanted to have, and there I am. We&#8217;ve nowhere to rush to, nothing to worry about. Summer is approaching.</p>
<p>What are some of your favorite deep cuts (non-singles) that you wished more people knew about or deserve to be known? While were on the related topic of nsync x deep cuts&#8230; here are 2 of my favorites. Yes, nsync, do it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A disclaimer, I can&#8217;t stand this era of sensationalist headlines and listicles. One of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqm5N-aA3u0">our recent videos</a> satired this. What I dislike even more are when these articles are misleading, but the general public is too lazy to dig just one step deeper to find out what is biased, exaggerated, or just plain false.</p>
<p>With that said, there was this article going around comparing San Francisco and Los Angeles last month… &#8220;WHICH IS THE BETTER CITY??&#8221; For those not from CA, this is a big debate between the two major cities of CA. &#8220;NorCal vs SoCal&#8221; for eternity. I read this article and found A LOT of problems and misinformation. I understand it was all done in fun, and so is this post. =) So here&#8217;s my take. Oh wait&#8230; I need a crazy headline.</p>
<p><strong>SF VS. LA! THE BEST CITY IS DETERMINED BY THIS ACCURATE (MOST BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN) STUDY! (youwontbelievewhathappensnext!)</strong></p>
<p>My arbitrary qualifications to speak on these city&#8217;s behalves&#8230; I grew up in the East Bay and have experienced a LOT of SF in my recent young adult years. I currently live in LA (the last 7 years) and would consider myself to know it quite well. To be fair, I&#8217;ve reached out to my good friend <a href="http://instagram.com/sujinchang">Susan</a> who is the opposite. She grew up on the outskirts of LA and now lives in SF and knows the city very well. (She also LOVES SF) and will balance any areas I&#8217;m not particularly knowledgable in.</p>
<p>ALSO, one important RULE  that this comparison must adhere to before we begin&#8230; The biggest mistake of the other article was not being consistent with &#8220;LA-LA&#8221; (downtown LA) and &#8220;LA&#8221; (SoCal), whereas SF was basically JUST SF. LA is HUGE, and generally ppl group everything in LA county together or single out &#8220;downtown LA&#8221; when it benefits their point. So to be fair, we are going to compare LA and SF and their 30 MINUTE radii, because that&#8217;s generally how the citizens of each city will live.</p>
<p>Herewego! Filled with glorious google image photos!</p>
<p><strong>WEATHER</strong></p>
<p><img id="i-118" class="size-full wp-image" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/weather.jpg?w=650" alt="Image" /><br />
If you want seasons, SF wins. It gets super cold in the winter (frost, no snow). Leaves change on schedule, Spring is bright, and Summers can be very hot on the East Bay. But that fog tho… it really does suck and it&#8217;s unpredictable. Susan would like to point out though that the fog can be very beautiful at times. Sure, well, the smog in LA gives us gorgeous sunsets, but we&#8217;d gladly give it up.</p>
<p>LA really does live up to the stereotypes. We have maybe one month of &#8220;cold&#8221; weather. This year we literally had one weekend of heavy rain (in Feb), and the rest has been high 70s or even 80s (in Jan). Winter literally skipped us, and it&#8217;s sunny all the time.<br />
<strong>LA WINS</strong> by a HAIR because <em>generally</em> ppl want &#8220;nice&#8221; weather more often than not. Don&#8217;t get mad yet&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>AIR QUALITY/POLLUTION</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/smog.jpg"><img id="i-119" class="size-full wp-image" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/smog.jpg?w=625" alt="Image" /></a><br />
(it <em>sometimes </em>actually looks like that from the plane)<br />
When LA has a clear day, it can actually be quite beautiful. Vast open city, big mountain ranges as the backdrop. But that&#8217;s WHEN LA has a clear day. Which is not THAT much of a rarity, but it&#8217;s definitely a treat when it happens. SMOG is very real.<br />
<strong>SF WINS</strong> easily. The Bay&#8217;s air is awesome. Sure LA has the sun shining all the time, but it shines through smog.</p>
<p><strong>BEACHES</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/beach.jpg"><img id="i-122" class="size-full wp-image" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/beach.jpg?w=650" alt="Image" /></a><br />
We&#8217;re talking about coasts, so we should compare beaches. Yes, even though portions of LA beaches are polluted and crowded, many are still very open, and you get the beach culture and hot enough weather to actually enjoy it. There are definitely more sandy beaches where you can play beach volleyball, tan, rollerblade/bike.. you can&#8217;t do that on rocks and cliffs (which don&#8217;t get me wrong, are beautiful too)<br />
<strong>LA WINS</strong></p>
<p><strong>PUBLIC TRANSIT/TRAFFIC</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/traffic2.jpg"><img id="i-126" class="size-full wp-image" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/traffic2.jpg?w=590" alt="Image" /></a><br />
(even the carpool lanes have traffic!)<br />
LA is a city that was not built w/ any public transit in mind. They&#8217;re trying, but the culture is set. People don&#8217;t want to take the metro except for the novelty or on very rare occasions to a special event. Buses are a last resort. And there are just too many people. So traffic is terrible. But there are windows and patterns to the traffic, so if you live here and drive enough, you know when to get on the road and when your 2 hr window is. haha.</p>
<p>SF has bad traffic too during the rush hours. The bridge, the 101, the maze.. but LA is definitely worse on a round the clock basis.<br />
<strong>SF WINS </strong>because BART is cool. And weekends actually mean clearer freeways.</p>
<p><strong>FOOD</strong> &#8211; Alright, this is where it&#8217;s gonna get messy and angry. We&#8217;ll need subcategories too&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Chinese</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='800' height='480' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/3n3HQ9uge0g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;start=68&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span><br />
</strong>This is where I feel like the other article gravely lost all its credibility. To say that SF&#8217;s Chinese food is &#8220;unparalleled to any Chinese food down south&#8221; is just plain ignorant. haha. I love the bay, but I have to admit, the Chinese food in the 626 is unrivaled. From countless Hong Kong cafes open to 4a, quirky and hip boba shops, reliable tea chains, mom and pop hole-in-the-walls, to legit famous restaurants from China/Taiwan testing in LA… 626 (and therefore part of the 30 min radius) beats SF&#8217;s Chinatown and Sunset by far. Yes the bay has the South Bay w/ Milpitas/Cupertino/etc, but that&#8217;s 50 min out at least.<br />
<strong>LA WINS</strong> don&#8217;t fight it. Susan agrees.</p>
<p><strong>Korean</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/ktown.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/ktown.jpg?w=800" alt="Ktown"   /></a><br />
</strong>Does SF even HAVE korean food? Gotta cross the bridge to Oakland. Nothing compares to LA&#8217;s Koreatown. Hell, Korea doesn&#8217;t even compare to Koreatown in some ways, lol.<br />
<strong>LA WINS</strong> no question. Susan (Korean herself) concedes. Even saying Norcal korean food is overpriced and mediocre at best.</p>
<p><strong>Mexican<br />
<a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/tacotruck.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-131" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/tacotruck.jpg?w=800" alt="Tacotruck"   /></a></strong><br />
I won&#8217;t even humor this with any sort of explanation.<br />
easy, no contest. <strong>LA WINS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Japanese<br />
</strong>LA has the very legit and quaint Little Tokyo. SF has Japantown.<br />
<strong><del>TIE</del><br />
*edit*</strong> My friend reminded me that LA <em>also</em> has Sawtelle Ave&#8230; <strong>LA WINS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vietnamese and Thai<br />
</strong>LA has Thaitown, Westminster thirty fiiiive min away and much of the 626 is Vietnamese too. <strong>Both go to LA.</strong>  (I know the Bay has South Bay with San Jose, but that&#8217;s 50 min away from SF.)</p>
<p>Alright, obviously this comparison is skewing Asian. <strong>Mediterranean, French, Spanish, Italian, Middle Eastern, etc</strong> all don&#8217;t have focused areas dedicated to these cuisines. There are definitely famous restaurants and establishments in both cities which can probably go head to head&#8230; but I&#8217;m going to guess <strong>LA WINS</strong>.. ONLY because there are more immigrants and immigrant communities in the greater LA area. LA has Little Ethiopia, there, does that tip the scale? I&#8217;m open to disagreements here, but I still think LA will win.</p>
<p><strong>American - </strong>Coffee, gastropubs, new american, bars, fine dining…</p>
<p><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/bestia1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-134" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/bestia1.jpg?w=715&#038;h=428" alt="bestia1" width="715" height="428" /></a><br />
I feel like this might also have to be split. Any restaurant or cafe Susan or someone could namedrop up there, LA has an answer and vice versa. Let&#8217;s just be happy that both cities are filled with inspired chefs, creators, and local markets to support delicious dining! <strong>TIE</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/crab.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-133" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/crab.jpg?w=647&#038;h=368" alt="crab" width="647" height="368" /></a></p>
<p>LA takes a lot of these categories, I feel bad.. umm <strong>Seafood</strong>. <strong>SF WINS</strong>. Now the food fight card looks a bit more respectable. Ain&#8217;t no one wants to eat seafood from LA waters, haha.</p>
<p><strong>DATING and SOCIAL CULTURE </strong>(had too hard of a time googling for representative pictures. Just use your imagination, it&#8217;s probably accurate)<br />
Okkk, would you rather have everyone be in tech or a non profit bragging about their new startup or incubation… or everyone be in &#8220;the industry&#8221; (entertainment) and talk about the short film, album, play they&#8217;re working on? Yes, not everyone is in these respective industries, but the stereotypes are true.<br />
<strong>TIE</strong>, both equally annoying and harboring douchery.</p>
<p>BUT… dating, I think I&#8217;m going to have to give to LA. A much more equal spread of males to females is why. I&#8217;ve had girls say the guys in the bay don&#8217;t have enough style and swag. And those that do, know they are a rarity and there are so few girls so they don&#8217;t feel inclined to settle down. I&#8217;ve had countless guys say there are NO girls in the bay and if there are, they don&#8217;t &#8220;try&#8221;… meaning, girls in LA dress up a bit more. One could say that&#8217;s superficial, one could say, that&#8217;s life and aren&#8217;t we all trying to impress someone? Girls admit it too. I&#8217;ve had several girls say they feel judged if they wear heels or false eyelashes out. <em>Hella</em> sad! People travel to LA to party and let loose. SF is known to be more &#8220;chill&#8221; (read: wear jeans and a northface fleece to go out)<br />
<strong>LA WINS~</strong> Depends on what your tastes are. We&#8217;re both skewing towards LA on this one.</p>
<p>In terms of general &#8220;vibe&#8221; though&#8230; I definitely believe that people from Norcal are more laid back, and Socal is, yes, a little more superficial. People around the bay seem to be more culturally aware and sensitve, and also worldly. Down in LA, there are more people who are looking for any way to fame and fortune and &#8220;fake it til you make it&#8221; mentalities, and this is reflected to the general culture. Look, there&#8217;s all types of people everywhere in this world. I&#8217;m not saying LA doesn&#8217;t have cultured and chill people, and that SF doesn&#8217;t have narcissism, but when you meet someone in LA who&#8217;s originally from SF, you instantly can tell.. &#8220;hey, you&#8217;re from the bay huh?&#8221;<br />
<strong>SF WINS~</strong></p>
<p><strong>NAPA<br />
</strong>Is that in the 30 min radius? Barely? Ok… can&#8217;t compete w/ wine. SB is def further. I&#8217;m only putting it on this list because the other article did.<br />
<strong>SF WINS</strong></p>
<p><strong>THEME PARKS</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/universalstudios.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-136" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/universalstudios.jpg?w=800&#038;h=447" alt="universalstudios" width="800" height="447" /></a><br />
</strong>LA is a city built on entertainment, so of course our theme parks are better and more numerous.<br />
<strong>LA WINS </strong>Not even counting Disneyland which is more than 30 min away.</p>
<p><strong>NATURE</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/muirwoods.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/muirwoods.jpg?w=800" alt="MuirWoods"   /></a><br />
</strong>As much as LA has been racking up points, SF should probably get like 10 extra points for this category. The green, the wilderness, the mountains, valleys, rolling hills, open space, water, did I mention green, makes SF one of the most beautiful places in the country. Ppl in LA want to go hiking, I scoff (yes, very snobby of me). But LA hiking is dusty, dirt paths, and you get 15 min into a wooded area and that&#8217;s supposed to be hiking. We can still see the million dollar homes on the neighboring hill!</p>
<p>LA is one big parking lot and strip mall with a few dusty mounds with dry bushes. SF is a gorgeous, lush, and fresh wonderland. LA has billboards EVERYWHERE, even in the &#8220;suburbs&#8221;.<br />
<strong>SF WINS</strong></p>
<p><strong>SPORTS</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/curry.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/curry.jpg?w=800&#038;h=400" alt="curry" width="800" height="400" /></a><br />
</strong>Time&#8217;s have changed. Somehow the Lakers are tanking and the Warriors are the 6th seed. Clippers are awesome, but for some reason LA is still a Lakers city. Warrior fans are not bandwagon, they&#8217;ve been there through it all. Probably how Clipper fans would be if the Lakers never existed.</p>
<p>49ers, Giants… <strong>SF WINS</strong> again. Oh.. but congrats to the Kings and Galaxy for their championships in 2013. A few ppl in your city cared.</p>
<p><strong>MUSIC/ENTERTAINMENT<br />
</strong>This depends what your tastes are so it&#8217;s hard to really quantify. What&#8217;s your preference of entertainment? Every major awards show, premiere, concert happens in LA. Susan says SF has more unity in certain city-wide events. Debatable. Bay to Breakers is a pretty good argument. Nightlife is bigger in LA I&#8217;d say, especially if you&#8217;re into clubs; LA is comparable to Las Vegas in many ways. Live music at a dive bar? Artisan cocktails at a hipster speakeasy? Swanky hotel rooftop lounge? Walking around aimlessly at an outdoor shopping center? Afternoons and evenings at a museum or art gallery?<strong><br />
LA WINS</strong> just cause it&#8217;s bigger and has more variety, so you&#8217;ll probably find something you like here.</p>
<p><strong>SNOW </strong>- breaking from the 30 min radius for a sec</p>
<p><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/snow.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-139" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/snow.jpg?w=800" alt="snow"   /></a><br />
Yes SF has Tahoe 3 hrs away, and Mammouth is an extra hr… but we have Mt High and Big Bear less  than 1 hr and 2 hrs away respectively. Even if the snow isn&#8217;t that good, we can still get our fix in in a morning and be back by lunch. (Literally, one morning I woke up at 6a, got to Mt High, boarded for 3 hrs, and was back to LA by noon) Can&#8217;t do that in SF. But that&#8217;s IF we get snow&#8230;<br />
<strong>LA WINS</strong></p>
<p><strong>UNIVERSITIES<br />
</strong>I don&#8217;t&#8217; care. I went to UCSD. YEAH SAN DIEGO!</p>
<p><strong>CITY BEAUTY</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/sfskyline.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-138" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/sfskyline.jpg?w=703&#038;h=369" alt="SFSkyline" width="703" height="369" /></a><br />
</strong>I&#8217;d hafta concede that SF is just a pretty city as a &#8220;city&#8221;. That simple Transamerica Tower is enough to make the skyline unique. Add two beautiful bridges and being surrounded by water, this is no contest. LA doesn&#8217;t allow buildings to NOT have helicopter pads on the roofs, meaning all buildings must be flat on the top. That is boring!</p>
<p>The architecture in dtla is very historical and nice, but i&#8217;m sure SF has that too. Everything else in LA are townhomes, apartment complexes, and strip malls. The hills and Victorian homes give SF a real LOOK.<br />
<strong>SF WINS</strong></p>
<p><strong>PARKS</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/goldengatepark.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-140" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/goldengatepark.jpg?w=726&#038;h=333" alt="GoldenGatePark" width="726" height="333" /></a><br />
As mentioned before, this sorta relates to the Nature category. Golden Gate park <em>alone</em> is like as big as all the &#8220;parks&#8221; in LA combined. Griffith and the Hollywood hills definitely try and are a fair offerings to LA&#8230; for being dry dust mounds. SF has too many parks and open spaces to even start naming.<br />
<strong>SF WINS</strong> no contest.</p>
<p><b>ART &amp; MUSEUMS</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/zoo.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-148" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/zoo.jpg?w=592&#038;h=395" alt="zoo" width="592" height="395" /></a><br />
</b>This <em>should</em> be a tie. Both cities have plenty of art museums (LACMA vs MOCA, Getty vs. DeYoung) One could argue about the specific collections but hey, let&#8217;s not turn this into a debate about art.  They both have great arts districts, a natural history museum, science museums (LA has the shuttlllle), and observatories (Chabot probably gets better images than Griffith).  So, if we gave LA all those food points for the <em>quantity</em> of choices&#8230; You know what it comes down to? SF has a zoo.. and another one in Oakland.<br />
<strong>SF WINS </strong> by a giraffe&#8217;s neck, at the other zoo.</p>
<p><strong>HOUSING</strong><br />
DTLA is about the same as SF proper. Consider the 30 min radius, I&#8217;m sure the living prices are comparable. But people seem more reluctant to live &#8220;outside&#8221; of SF, where as ppl in LA are from neighborhoods all over and there&#8217;s no shame in saying one area or another. SF is a little pretentious that way.<br />
<strong>LA WINS</strong></p>
<p><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/recycling.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-143" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/recycling.jpg?w=537&#038;h=438" alt="recycling" width="537" height="438" /></a><br />
</strong>LA is definitely trying to catch up. Our plastic bag ban came 1 yr after SFs. Local farmers markets are popping up more and more. Environmental initiatives are peaking out, but I sorta figure all these ideas are coming from people who&#8217;ve seen them first executed in other cities, namely SF, and wanting to bring them down to LA.<br />
<strong>SF WINS</strong> but really everyone wins because who cares where it starts, as long as it&#8217;s spreading!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IN CONCLUSION&#8230;</strong> Which city is the best???<br />
<strong>IT DEPENDS!</strong> Wow, how anticlimatic. Ok, if you actually tally it up, LA won by a handful (really racked up points in Food). A comparison like this can&#8217;t count points for points because depending on your personality, each category and point is weighted differently. Someone who ranks nature lower and is fine with Runyon Canyon will say LA. Someone who wants to be able to get around their city without sitting in a car will say SF. In the end, LA is just bigger and a much more diverse melting pot, so there are more choices of everything. But SF loses these square miles to rolling hills, grand cliffs, and a beautiful bay that cradles and beautiful city. I think I&#8217;m a pretty reasonable guy, and Susan is too. Hopefully this article compared fairly, and maybe will help those from outside of CA better understand the cities. CA in general is a freaking AWESOME state, and we&#8217;re lucky that we can even have these two metropolises to argue between.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/30/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/30/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wongfuphil.wordpress.com&#038;blog=62283787&#038;post=30&#038;subd=wongfuphil&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Remember when &#8220;I like you&#8221; was enough? &#8220;I like you&#8221; was the end all goal. &#8220;I like you&#8221; was the prize. Remember when &#8220;I like you&#8221; was enough?</p>
<p>I can pull out the journal and go to the specific page and entry when I first heard those words from the girl that I also liked. For the first time, it was mutual. For the first time, of all the people that I could &#8220;like&#8221;, she &#8220;liked&#8221; me back. At the time, I innocently called it a &#8220;phenomenon&#8221; of some sort, that two people could match this way in this world. &#8220;I like you&#8221; was enough. She became my first girlfriend. She became my first love.</p>
<p>Remember when &#8220;I love you&#8221; was enough? &#8220;I love you&#8221; was the epitome, all you needed. &#8220;I love you&#8221; was when you found the one. Remember when &#8220;I love you&#8221; was enough?</p>
<p>But that was before ex-boyfriends, before ex-girlfriends. Before her disapproving parents. Before his parents you couldn&#8217;t stand. This was before that little bad habit that grew into the most annoying thing ever. Before that little mole became all you saw. Before being cheated on by someone you trusted your life with. Before letting your thoughts stray to someone else. This was before pretending to like baseball. Before wishing he&#8217;d enjoy dancing, and sitting through musicals just to make her happy. &#8220;I love you&#8221; was enough before other &#8220;I love you&#8217;s&#8221;. &#8220;I love you&#8221; was enough before you realized &#8220;I thought I loved you.&#8221; It was enough before long distance meant seeing each other once a month. Before moving to New York because this was her only chance, or him taking the job in Chicago.  Before you realized you were never going to convert. This was before he was ready for kids and I wasn&#8217;t; and even before she wanted to get married and I still missed being a bachelor. It was before we were hurt so deeply, before we hurt others so selfishly. It was enough, until it you found out, it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Remember when &#8220;I like you&#8221; was enough?</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/27/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/27/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wongfuphil.wordpress.com&#038;blog=62283787&#038;post=27&#038;subd=wongfuphil&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love seeing things come full circle. People, relationships, experiences. Meaning is found, reason is given, resolution is&#8230; granted. Peace. The stage you dreamed of performing on is the one you stand on now. The artist you idolized turns into someone you collaborate with. The family member who left, returns to your life. The ex you hated so much is your friend once more. All those questions and fears you had, you now have answers to.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about what circles you are just beginning now? Perhaps even the ones you think are completing, are actually still revolving.</p>
<p>That same stage, you&#8217;re now over it. The artist you collaborated with becomes your competition. You realize you can&#8217;t forgive that family member. The ex you thought was just a friend still has feelings for you, as you secretly hoped. All those answers, just lead to new questions.</p>
<p>How do we really know when a cycle has ended? We can&#8217;t.. because time moves forward, and so, these circles continue to rotate. And that&#8217;s why I love the idea of &#8220;full circle&#8221;, because it gives me the momentary perception that there is rest, a conclusion.. until something comes along to stir it all up again.</p>
<p>To continue the show-and-tell of shorts that may never be released, here is another screen cap from something that was shot a few months ago which I&#8217;m not sure will ever come out.</p>
<p><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-01-14-at-7-33-34-pm.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-25" alt="Screen shot 2014-01-14 at 7.33.34 PM" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-01-14-at-7-33-34-pm.png?w=800&#038;h=447"   /></a><br />
Written and shot during a tumultuous time and mindset, I can&#8217;t say that it&#8217;s something I&#8217;d want to share with the public now, at least in the form it is in. It needs to be rewritten, re-considered. It&#8217;s really amazing to see how words and stories can change and evolve. But I know that this frame, this scene, will come full circle someday. Still rotating.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/24/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/24/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wongfuphil.wordpress.com&#038;blog=62283787&#038;post=24&#038;subd=wongfuphil&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month we released a short film called &#8220;ONE&#8221;. It was written in Nov and shot in Dec of last year. It stars international pop star Wang Leehom. It is about different dimensions and whether you are living the one you want to be in. For the commentary of the video itself, read <a href="http://wongfuproductions.com/2014/01/one-ft-wang-leehom-new-video/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='800' height='480' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/B2G-pK75h7g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>A few years ago, I began to enjoy believing that multiple dimensions existed. The reason for this is because, I wanted to believe that there was another version of &#8220;me&#8221; somewhere out there, living a life according to all the decisions and risks I had not had the courage or opportunities to take. It was my cop out. People I wanted to speak up to. Emotions I wanted to explore. Desires I yearned to give in to. But I didn&#8217;t. And so, I found comfort that while <em>I</em> was not living it in <em>my</em> reality, somewhere else, I was.</p>
<p>I really wanted to make a short story about this concept, but never got around to writing any sort of script. The premise of different dimensions and realities came up often at the Wong Fu office in a few story ideas between Wes and myself. And when this project came around, it seemed like a good place to apply it. And so, I finally had an &#8220;excuse&#8221; to write it out in some form.</p>
<p>But before ONE, this concept actually shifted in meaning as my life was changing. Wonderful things happened that made me believe I was living in the reality I so desperately desired. I felt like I was no longer allowed to (or needed to) believe in another dimension where things could be &#8220;better&#8221;.. no, not better.. &#8220;different&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t necessary because I was in the best case scenario. And so the idea became, <em>while I enjoy believing in multiple dimensions, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not in any other one.</em>       ..but when there are infinite possibilities, how does one ever truly know which is the right one to live? Perhaps you will never know, it&#8217;s faith. Perhaps you will always wonder, you must suppress it.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t able to yet.</p>
<p>And now I&#8217;ve arrived at a new plot point. One where I&#8217;ve completely turned an entire timeline of a potential future upside down, selfishly jumping onto another timeline. Why? For many years now, I&#8217;ve had the twisted belief that the <em>pursuit</em> of happiness is better than actually reaching it. Because while in pursuit, happiness is just an idea, it&#8217;s perfect, it&#8217;s perpetual. But once <em>attained</em>, it can be questioned, it can be tainted, it can be lost. &#8230; (i&#8217;m not proud of this mindset, it&#8217;s not healthy)</p>
<p>And so for the time being, I continue in pursuit (yes, aka &#8220;chase&#8221;). I continue to dimension hop. Getting glimpses, concluding on some variables, wavering on others, trying to figure out, where to place myself in infinity. Maybe this journey itself is the &#8220;one&#8221;.</p>
<p>Prior to ONE, I actually did try to shoot a short based on these thoughts. It wasn&#8217;t a whole story though, it was just a scene, it was just over a year ago, while I was out of the country. Here&#8217;s a still frame from it&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/oz-train.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-19" alt="OZ-Train" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/oz-train.png?w=800&#038;h=445" width="800" height="445" /></a><br />
probably will never come out. It&#8217;s ok tho. ONE is basically it, but better :1</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/18/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/18/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wongfuphil.wordpress.com&#038;blog=62283787&#038;post=18&#038;subd=wongfuphil&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever listen to a sad song, and become emotional not because you relate to the words on your side, but because you feel like it could be the words and feelings of the other?</p>
<p>Sometimes I hear the emotions in the lyrics and melody, and I think&#8230; could I have caused them to feel this way? Is this &#8220;their&#8221; song? Was this what they went through, or are going through? And the thought of <em>that</em> is actually what makes me sad, the notion that I inflicted <em>this</em>, this sadness, anger, insecurity. Not that the words and message of the song reflect my feelings.  (I do not take pride in this at all, it&#8217;s not a good thing. Just wondering if others feel the same)</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the reason why I enjoy Taylor Swift&#8217;s songs so much. (Yes, I just said Taylor Swift as my example). I&#8217;m obviously not a teenage (excuse me, 22-oo-OO-OO) blonde girl, but sometimes her songs give me a sense of what a girl in my past may have thought because of me. And it&#8217;s an intense feeling, of guilt, or regret. And isn&#8217;t that what music is supposed to do? Make you feel? So yes, I&#8217;m a fan of Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one of her more recent ones that when it came out made me think &#8230; &#8220;I wonder if I was on the wrong end of this song in her life?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='800' height='480' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/cMPEd8m79Hw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Sucha good song. (btw, I would never have a problem with any girl wearing high heels. Who would??)</p>
<p>Perhaps <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2U0Ivkn2Ds">this</a> is a better example..</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/16/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/16/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wongfuphil.wordpress.com&#038;blog=62283787&#038;post=16&#038;subd=wongfuphil&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve always been too nostalgic. Too much reverence for the past. I wouldn&#8217;t say I &#8220;live&#8221; in the past, because I definitely take in each present moment and try to enjoy every experience given to me&#8230; but my mind always wanders back. That&#8217;s natural though, right? The past is what we know, so of course that&#8217;s where our thoughts would go?</p>
<p>I guess to a certain extent, I do live too much in, or <em>for</em>, the past. And then, I let the way I see the future be affected by that. I&#8217;m afraid of the past becoming further and further, of losing &#8220;the past&#8221;. I need to stop this. Wasn&#8217;t the &#8220;past&#8221; you grip on so tightly to, at some point a &#8220;future&#8221;. Be nostalgic, for what&#8217;s ahead.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t give <em>too</em> much weight to what has preceded, that would imply you&#8217;re nearing or at the end. We are only just beginning.</p>
<p>(Post that contradicts everything said here to come later -_-&#8221;)</p>
<p>nostalgia related.. I recently purchased BSB newest album. It&#8217;s actually quite good. I felt like after going all these yrs, I should show some support for what they&#8217;ve provided me. Something about them sticking together too is significant to me. While on that page, there was a package to get ALL their previous albums for like $25. Considering I napster&#8217;d/kazaa&#8217;d a good portion of their songs in hs, I owe it to them to buy them now that I can afford to (and hell, it&#8217;s only $5 a cd). So somehow my Amazon cart ended up looking like this on a random sunday night&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/amazoncart.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-14" alt="AmazonCart" src="http://wongfuphil.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/amazoncart.jpg?w=448&#038;h=448" width="448" height="448" /></a><br />
yes.. TMNT figurines also ended up in there &#8220;somehow&#8221;. What did I tell you?</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/13/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/13/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wongfuphil.wordpress.com&#038;blog=62283787&#038;post=13&#038;subd=wongfuphil&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is my new journal. I have been writing consistently since March 2000. It is my 11th journal, and I just started it, coincidently, on the first day of this yr. I bought it in Korea 2 years ago (or was it in Singapore 1.5 yrs ago?). Either way, when it was purchased I was only a quarter through my previous journal and starting this one felt so far away. &#8230;Yet here I am, and in a position I never expected to be&#8230; because time keeps moving and life tends to throw the unexpected at you.</p>
<p>I often, very often, read back through old journals. I like to search for patterns, reminders, lessons. They are my life&#8217;s &#8220;textbooks&#8221;. I can see how things I felt were so dire, pan out. I see resolutions to problems and drama. I see worries that ultimately did not need to be worried about. And I see the same topics come up, over, and over again. I write about the good and the bad. I write about family, a lot about my work and career, and&#8230; relationships. I&#8217;ve written a lot about relationships, girls. I hate that. I know there are guys (and girls) who can move easily through emotions and relationships. But so much of <em>my</em> joy, and struggles, are at the mercy of a female. W/out trying to be poetic about it&#8230; &#8220;girl problems&#8221;.</p>
<p>I hate &#8220;girl problems&#8221; because on the surface, it seems so petty, so #firstworldproblems. I can&#8217;t help but think about my parents and the &#8220;real&#8221; problems they dealt with. Immigrating here in their late 20s w/ nothing. Or our grandparents, living in poverty, through horrific wars and revolutions. Their problems were &#8220;survival&#8221;. And here I am writing years and years, pages and pages about &#8220;i like her&#8221;, &#8220;I can&#8217;t move on&#8221;, &#8220;what do i do..wah wah&#8221;. While my grandma had to flee her city from the invading Japanese. Okay, phil.</p>
<p>While I will (hopefully) never experience that degree of suffering, I am reminded that in the end, we are all still human. And as humans we <em>need/crave</em> companionship and <em>love</em>. Due to the circumstances the generations before had to endure, they may have had to swallow their concerns and fears with love, but nonetheless, they too had girl problems, right? And even if not back then, nowadays, after their world has calmed down a bit, the result of their swallowed feelings surface. Resentment, regret&#8230; a whole other level of &#8220;relationship problems&#8221;, weighted with decades of weight.</p>
<p>So, what appears to just be girl problems, maybe is rooted in my family problems, which is rooted in those bigger cultural and global problems from the previous century. Not to blow my &#8220;issues&#8221; out of proportion, but perhaps I&#8217;m just the latest edge of a ripple which began decades ago&#8230; <em>centuries</em> ago? Wasn&#8217;t Helen of Troy just a big girl problem? Cleopatra? Were lovers not lost and longed for due to wars and expeditions West? I suppose I should be thankful girl problems are the bulk of my burden. (and fortunately I have the sympathies of Jay-Z) #pointsifyougetit</p>
<p>I have no idea if any of that made sense. I&#8217;m not going to even proofread. Excuse the typos. And I apologize in advance&#8230; what&#8217;s to follow may also be just about girl problems. ugh, i know. I also hope I can be consistent with this blog. It&#8217;d be really sad/embarrassing if this was like, my only post for months.</p>
<p>EDIT: I proofread. No excuses now.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/2/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wongfuphil.wordpress.com/2/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wongfuphil.wordpress.com&#038;blog=62283787&#038;post=2&#038;subd=wongfuphil&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
